1) PCL:
Download and install the windows PCL
  -It will fail on OpenNI, this is fine.
Download and install the OpenNI (patched) from the PCL download page.
Download and install the Sensor-Win (patched) from the PCL download page.

(You may be able to get away with just OpenNI, but I've not tested this.)

Note: You will have to run a lot of these installers as administrator, possibly with some weird ways.

2) Cuda:
Goto nvidia, download cuda (I've used v8.0)
if(8.0):
  Go into it's installed directory, subfolder bin, make a copy of cudart64_80.dll and name it cudaart64_70.dll

3) Reboot.

#It still won't work. Cuda sucks.

Some things will now work, but pcl_kingfu doesn't, cuda is broken.
