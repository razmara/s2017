Global Registration:
  -Reads in the 100-0.log as a segment_traj
   -Generates the init.log.. (first set of them identical, then new data.)
   -Generates the pose_traj, (Based off init_traj..)
   -Generates result.txt, (Via an almost identical to an already-run methoid..)
  -Uses PCL's align, and the result-log of kinfu
  


  cleanup: See if possible to remove the do_all(), or merge it.. see if it's different at all.. like wth.
