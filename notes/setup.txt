Setting it (my pcl) up on archlinux:
  -Install base os of arch linux.
  -Install:
    -Cuda
    -Nvidia (untested if this is actually required)
    -gcc5 (if not already)
    -From AUR:
      -openni
      -openni2
      -eigen
      -flann
      -vtk
    
    Note: You need to recompile opencv with gcc5 flags
    
    Then use the PKGBUILD and it should work.
