TODO:

Aug21: - Check if built version of PCL from Relase thing is good, as SeperateKinfu is having a boost pointer issue.

Test:
  -Re-enable avx in pcl:gpu:CMakeLists.txt

OpenCV approach:
  -Handle misalignment of depth+camera pos.
  -Handle dropped/no transformations..
  -Rewrite (ie, non-hack-version)
    -`Optical flow`

Document everything I know

Improve Kinect intrisics:
  (Getting other device intrinsics aswell?)
  -Manual calibration (via openCV?)
  -Seperated Image Registration (External to when just recorded, General for any cameras)
  -Save to file to loadin/use as needed (currently using cam.param format, doesn't have everything needed)
  

Improve Kinect Image registration:
  -Raytrace? (bad with noise)
  -Generic image registration programs?
  -Understand the driver included one.

SeperateKinfu: (Erik?)
  -Cuda-less implmentation of kinfu.
  -Less depedencies on PCL.
