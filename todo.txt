Meeting on monday.
Bring: Struct sensor, cable, ipad, Kinect

Calculate error of data from ref_traj.txt
  -Maybe highlights sources of error
  -Save it from integrate

Get our own input into the pipeline.
  -Via revamping the kinfuLS.app to accept a .oni from OpenNI2 (erik)
  -Via making an Openni2 .oni to OpenNi .oni converter. (scott)
    -Make event based.
    -Verify number of modes available.
    -Cleanup DepthGenerater
      -Make Image/IR
    -Create the companion recording application.

Verify the results of kinfu's trajectories:
  -Make input of a path we know (ie, no moving camera -> move camera left, etc.)
  -Compair sequences of it to the ref_traj of the virtual data scenes.

Verify/Understand GraphOptmizer / G2O.
  -What is it doing, pcd's as edges, and the transformations as verticies?
