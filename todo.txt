Figure out how to merge standfordPCL with PCL.
	-Search history of PCl for closest start with StanfordPCL...
	(Seems theres some nice SVN revision id's in some files... but they seem a little.... several thousand revisions missing...)

Merge in the required componenets of standford PCL for the kinfuApp, for generating fragments and whatnot.
	Seems the only source of this is from his git, which is detached from the oriognal.
	--fragment

CMake ALL the rest of the ER_port
	-GraphOptimizer

Test the ported code with what we can of the windows binary.

PCL <-> Compile, play with /test

Papers <-> Read them, make some nice summaries.

OpenNI2 <-> getting pictures & depth pictures, turning on IR light for scanner?
  -Erik is working on this(?)
