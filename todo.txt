Get our own input into the pipeline.
  -Via revamping the kinfuLS.app to accept a .oni from OpenNI2
  -Via making an Openni2 .oni to OpenNi .oni converter.

Verify the results of kinfu's trajectories:
  -Make input of a path we know (ie, no moving camera -> mvoe camera left, etc.)
  -Compair sequences of it to the ref_traj of the virtual data scenes.

Verify/Understand GraphOptmizer / G2O.
  -What is it doing, pcd's as edges, and the transformations as verticies?

Make usefull results out of GR/GO/BC, and format it for Integrate

Make Integrate have an option for handling out-of-order frameID's.
