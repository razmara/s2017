TODO:
Find the bug within the pipeline!

Improve Kinect Image registration:
  -Raytrace? (bad with noise)
  -Generic image registration programs?
  -Understand the driver included one.

Calculate error of data from ref_traj.txt
  -Find the source of error(?)

Verify the results of kinfu's trajectories:
  -Make input of a path we know (ie, no moving camera -> move camera left, etc.)
  -Compair sequences of it to the ref_traj of the virtual data scenes.
  -Find the source of error(?)

Verify/Understand GraphOptmizer / G2O.
  -What is it doing, pcd's as edges, and the transformations as verticies?

SeperateKinfu: (Erik?)
  -Cuda-less implmentation of kinfu.
  -Less depedencies on PCL.
