Figure out how to merge standfordPCL with PCL.
	-Search history of PCl for closest start with StanfordPCL... 10k lines.
	(Seems theres some nice SVN revision id's in some files... but they seem a little.... several thousand revisions missing...)

Papers <-> Read them, make some nice summaries.

OpenNI2 <-> getting pictures & depth pictures, turning on IR light for scanner?
	-Erik is working on this(?)
	-NiViewer does this(?)
	-Many 3rd party things seem to also.
