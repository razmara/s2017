CMake ALL the rest of the ER_port & port it.
    #Ported(?)
	-FragmentOptimizer
        -SuiteSparse 
        -Eigen - Works if I stub out that one line, I should handle that properly though. (A new class that inherits from it, and exposes a writter or makes m_value public)
	-GraphOptimizer
    #Not yet ported. (?)
	-Integrate
	-GlobalRegistration
