May 11:
  Moved the scanner to Erik's pc, to allow for it to scan w/ a graphics card (Also, narrowed it down to the lack of a gfx card being the issue.)
  Created & tested Cmake for BuildCorrespondence
    -Tested it with cmake -G xcode aswell, it builds, although I'm not entierly sure where....
  Tested 3d-reconstruction on mac/linux - works fine with cmake.
  Tested same programs on windows, have no idea how anyone uses windows for anything.
    -OpenCV also has a not-so great installer, (Simply puts abunch of files in a folder.)

May 10:
  Fixed windows in a VM issues, (USB-passthough works, albeit the scanner app currently crashes)
    -Due to this, that scanner is being moved to eirk's pc, so that I can remote into it.

  Finished setting up linux/windows on the gaming-pc thing.   
  
  Tested tempalte's cmake on sonny's mac, doesn't work, however,
  Adding in the exports recommened from brew info openni2, it does work.
  
  Made a CMakeLists work for 3D-reconstruction, and tested this on a mac, I believe it to work on linux, and will also test it on windows.

May 9:
  Attempted to install abunch of things on windows - didn't really work
  Scanned with EniScan-pro, it kinda works, but still had harsh edges where there were none. It also seems to break the OS in some weird way... a reboot fixes it though.
  Attempted to run windows in a VM - lots of complications.

=======
May 9:

  Is a long and slow processes, will be doing it in a VM now.

  Looked for what creatues the 3D model within the apps they have, it's just included with the SDK binarys which we donot have accsess to.
  Agreed that we want to simply recording images and use them for post-processing. (w/ others)
