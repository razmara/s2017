  -Found it via stanford PCL git commit message ' 	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/Kintinuous' '
  - It has this license: http://www.cs.nuim.ie/research/vision/data/kintinuous/code.php
    -Excplicitly says no commercial use
  -PCL doesn't have this,
    -Stanford PCL pulled this code from before the time that this git exsisted.
